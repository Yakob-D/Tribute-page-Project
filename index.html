            <p class="first">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">1914- </span>Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1918- </span>Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
                    thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">1933- </span>Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
                    left scars on me."</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1935- </span>Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1938- </span>Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
                    cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
                    about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1940- </span>Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but
                    is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                    disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1942- </span>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1944- </span>Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
                    pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,
                    his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
                    for each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">1946- </span>Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat
                    yields
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">1950- </span>crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
                    American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
                    Mexico's wheat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="last">"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one
                man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</p>
